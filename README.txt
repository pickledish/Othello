Othello Group Project

Brandon Som and Jeff

Goal is to make a working version of Othello that has an AI that can beat you and various good things! 

Side goal is to learn how the hell Github works, is good fun

** Make sure you guys pull the lastest versions before working on the code!

Current Goals!

Brandon: Get the getViableMoves() function actually working
Jeff: Get the thing to "capture" tiles caught between colors after a move is made
Som: Some sort of AI thing, you've got the algorithm for now? Godspeed
